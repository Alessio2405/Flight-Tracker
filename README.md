### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Data Source

This application fetches data directly from the OpenSky Network API in the browser. As the API does not provide the necessary CORS headers for direct browser access, all requests are routed through a free, public CORS proxy: `api.allorigins.win`.

This has two implications:
1.  The application's functionality is dependent on the availability and performance of this third-party proxy.
2.  The proxy has its own rate limits. To respect these limits, data is fetched every 60 seconds.

For a production environment, it would be recommended to create a dedicated backend service to act as a proxy and cache layer.
